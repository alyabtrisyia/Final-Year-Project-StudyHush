# Project Background
StudyHush is a mobile app designed to help students stay focused and avoid distractions caused by their phones. Many students struggle to concentrate due to constant notifications and interruptions, which leads to poor time management and reduced productivity.

The app brings together several helpful study tools in one platform including app blocking, custom study schedules with reminders, focus timers, progress tracking, group study features, background sounds and more.

By the end of this project, a complete and functional Android version of StudyHush will be developed to support students in building consistent, effective, and distraction-free study routines.

# Problem Statement
Students often lose focus because their phones interrupt their study sessions. This makes it difficult for them to manage their time and finish their tasks properly.

Moreover, most existing applications offer only a limited range of features individually. This forces undergraduate students to ineffectively switch between multiple apps to manage a single study session. 

Additionally, many apps lack motivational elements like streaks and gamification, making it hard for students to stay consistent and build long-term study habits.

# Objetives 
The following are the objectives to be applied within the application that being develop :

1. To develop a mobile application that blocks non-essential applications during study
sessions.
2. To integrate features such as custom study schedule, focus timer feature and
analytics dashboard into a single platform.
3. To implement a motivational system using streak tracking and gamification to
encourage students to maintain consistent study habits over time.
